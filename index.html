    <h2>My attempt of creating devlogs, January 2023</h2>
    <p>Back in January 2023, I started this exciting journey to document my game development process through devlogs. This video is the first 55 seconds I edited as part of that attempt. The game was progressing well, but unfortunately, I never completed the full video.
Shortly after, I got deeply involved in my JEE preparation and had to put the project and devlogs on hold.
Now, after a long break, I’m slowly getting back into learning game development again bit by bit, day by day. This video stands as a reminder of where I left off, and the journey I’m preparing to restart.
Thanks for watching 💙
