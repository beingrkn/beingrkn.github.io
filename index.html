        <h2>About Me</h2>
        <p>I am still at the beginner stage of my journey, learning and creating new things every day. My interests
            revolve around Discord bots, Minecraft servers, and video games. I usually begin my day struggling to start
            a project from scratch — but the excitement of building keeps me going.</p>
        <p>When I'm not working, I love investing time talking to new people on Discord, expanding my network, and
            sharing ideas.</p>
