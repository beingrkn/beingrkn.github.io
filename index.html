        <h2>Projects</h2>

        <h3>Portfolio Website for<a href="https://mehulsen.in/ target="_blank"> Mehul Sen (Video Editor)</a></h3>
        <p class="date">Role: Project Manager & Technical Lead</p>
        <p>I led the development of a personal portfolio website for Mehul Sen,
            a professional video editor, where I managed a two-member team from start to finish.
            As the project manager and technical lead, I was responsible for overseeing the development process, 
            ensuring smooth collaboration, and delivering the project on time. 
            My role extended beyond team coordination to handling all technical aspects of the deployment,
            including DNS configurations, domain and hosting setup, and integrating Cloudflare for enhanced security and performance.
            This project allowed me to combine leadership with hands-on technical work, resulting in a well-optimized, client-ready website that effectively showcases Mehul’s creative portfolio.</p>


        <h3>Minecraft–Discord Voice Verification System (Java, Python, MongoDB)</h3></h3>
        <p>For Mr. Random’s Minecraft SMP, I developed a real-time voice verification system that connected the Minecraft Java server with his Discord community using MongoDB. 
        The system allowed users to register for the SMP, during which a document was created in a MongoDB database containing their in-game name (ign), Discord ID (discord_id), and a voice_state boolean.
        A custom Discord bot written in Python monitored users' voice channel activity and updated the voice_state to true whenever a user joined a VC, and to false when they left.
        On the server side, I created a custom Minecraft plugin in Java that regularly queried the database every second. Before allowing a player to join, the plugin checked whether their voice_state was set to true.
        If not, they were prevented from joining. Additionally, if a player left the Discord VC while already in-game, the plugin would automatically detect the change and kick them from the server in real time. 
        This integration ensured that only those actively participating in the voice chat were allowed to play, encouraging better communication and collaboration among players. 
        The project showcased seamless cross-platform synchronization between Minecraft, Discord, and MongoDB.</p>

        <h3>Custom Model Renderer for Minecraft (Java)</h3>
        <p>Developed a custom model rendering system for Minecraft modding in Java. 
        This tool automates the creation of new entity models by generating separate renderer classes, making it easier to integrate custom 3D models into the game.
        It streamlines the process of defining model structure, animations, and textures, ensuring modular, organized, and scalable code-ideal for large modding projects or complex entity designs.</p>

        <h3>Among Us Random Map Generator</h3>
        <p>During the peak of Among Us popularity, I created a fun side project - a Random Among Us Map Generator.
            It lets users generate unique, randomized layouts inspired by the game's classic maps, adding a twist of unpredictability to each session. 
            Built purely for fun and creativity, it showcases my ability to blend trends with interactive tools while experimenting with design and logic.</p>

        <h3>Terrain Generator (Unity)</h3>
        <p>I developed a procedural terrain generator in Unity using Perlin Noise, allowing dynamic creation of landscapes with customizable parameters like elevation, scale, and texture mapping.
        This project showcases my understanding of procedural generation, Unity’s terrain system, and real-time rendering. It was built as an experimental tool to explore how games generate natural environments on the fly.</p>

        <h3>Team Chat Plugin for Minecraft (Java - Spigot)</h3>
        <p>Created a custom Minecraft Java plugin for Mr. Random’s special event featuring three themed teams: Desert, Snow, and Forest. 
        The plugin introduced a toggable team chat system, allowing players to seamlessly switch between team-only communication and global chat during gameplay. 
        Designed for performance and simplicity, the system helped improve coordination while keeping the event immersive and organized. 
        Built using the Spigot API.</p>

    <h2>My attempt of creating devlogs, January 2023</h2>
    <p>Back in January 2023, I started this exciting journey to document my game development process through devlogs. This video is the first 55 seconds I edited as part of that attempt. The game was progressing well, but unfortunately, I never completed the full video.
Shortly after, I got deeply involved in my JEE preparation and had to put the project and devlogs on hold.
Now, after a long break, I’m slowly getting back into learning game development again bit by bit, day by day. This video stands as a reminder of where I left off, and the journey I’m preparing to restart.
Thanks for watching 💙
